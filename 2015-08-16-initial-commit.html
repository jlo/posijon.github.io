      <p>I started a blog today. I used middleman to build a static site and deploy on github pages. It was all free because I can have one free personal github pages site, and the .me domain was free on namecheap. I'm currently attempting to stylize using bourbon, neat, and bitters.</p>

<p>I wasn't trying to start a blog. It just happened. I don't anticipate any more posts, so if there are any, it'll be a pleasant (indifferent?) surprise for all of us. I was actually trying to start a project site that links to github. In short, I've not accomplished what I set out to do. But I will. You'll see.</p>

<p>I'll learn all the formatting laterâ€¦</p>
